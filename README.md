# WeatherEffect

## Description

Minecraft artificial weather effect through particle builder, playsound and effects. Works with custom biome datapacks. If you created some cools effect in the config you can let me know and I can share it in the wiki.

Sparks your creativity super customizable. Change the game Mechanic.

I realized with this plugin you can do alot of things. Like multiple particle types in a biome. Chance of playing sound in biome. Summon Specific Entities with chance in a biome. All configurable whether if rain, thunder, or clear, specific biomes, detect material type at location particles spawning, skylight checks, block above checks and more...

## Dependencies

> [NBT API Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nbt-api.7939/) - Please download this plugin. As it's required to work.
> 
> This plugin uses particlebuidler from Paper please use Paper or other Paper forks.
> 
> Tested on 1.17.1, not confirmed on lower versions and should work just fine.

## To do list
